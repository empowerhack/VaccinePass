# VaccinePass

A (hybrid) mobile app for Syrian refugee parents to keep track of their childrens' vaccinations.

##The App Basics
The main users of this app will be refugee parents staying in camps, e.g. in Turkey or Lebanon.
The app will concentrate only on children aged 0-5.
The parent will download the app, enter names (or aliases) and ages of their children. 
A list of potential vaccines will show up - the parent can tick the vaccines they are sure the child has been given, otherwise it will be assumed the child doesn't have them.
Main page will show tabs for each child, with details of vaccinations.
Another child can be added at any time.
Data is only stored locally on the phone.

##The Use of the App
Each participating NGO will have a series of barcdoes printed out in their office/clinic:
- A barcode for the NGO (specific to that camp?)
- A barcode for each relevant vaccine for under 5 year olds

When a parent comes in to vaccinate their child(ren), they can show the doctor the vaccines their child(ren) has/have been given.
When giving a vaccine, the doctor will scan the NGO barcode and the barcodes for the vaccines given.
The parent chooses which child these vaccines were for, and the details of the vaccine will be held for that child:
- Name of vaccine
- NGO who provided vaccine
- Date vaccine given
